// BucketBase is the MediaWiki API root of the OSRS Wiki proper. This is a different host and a different service from the prices API: Bucket is the wiki's structured-data extension, holding the facts that wiki templates render into pages.
//
// It is a supported interface rather than scraping. The wiki's own documentation offers it to outside tools in as many words: "External users can query Bucket's API to get this information, without needing to scrape or parse wiki pages." It replaced Semantic MediaWiki, whose api.php?action=ask is hard-deprecated — do not reach for that instead.

// bucketPageSize is how many rows one query asks for. The server truncates at 5000 rather than erroring, so a full read pages with .offset() until a short page arrives.
const bucketPageSize = 5000

// maxBucketRows caps a paged read. Nothing we query is anywhere near this — storeline was 6326 rows when this was written — so hitting it means the offset paging is not advancing and the loop must stop rather than hammer a volunteer-run wiki forever.
const maxBucketRows = 100000

// StoreLine is one row of the wiki's storeline bucket: one item on one shop's shelf.
//
// Every field is a string, including the numeric ones, because the bucket declares them TEXT. That is not laziness upstream — it carries real distinctions that an int cannot: Stock is "∞" for a shelf that never runs out and "N/A" where nobody has recorded one, which is a different claim from "0". Parsing is left to the caller so those three cases survive the trip.
type StoreLine struct {
	Shop      string `json:"sold_by"`
	Item      string `json:"sold_item"`

	Stock     string `json:"store_stock"`      // base stock: "∞", "N/A" or an integer
	Restock   string `json:"restock_time"`
	Currency  string `json:"store_currency"` // "Coins" for ordinary shops, otherwise Tokkul, points, tickets...
	Notes     string `json:"store_notes"`    // shop variant: diary tier, quest state, seasonal mode

// StoreLines fetches every row of the storeline bucket: what each shop in the game stocks, at what price, in what quantity.
//
// This is the data that makes a shop-buy claim checkable. The prices API's per-item `value` looks like a shop price and is not one — it is the base value from the item definitions, present for every item in the game whether or not anything sells it — so ranking on `value` alone produces a list of items nobody can buy at any price.
//
// About 6300 rows in two requests. It only changes on game updates, so poll it daily at most.
