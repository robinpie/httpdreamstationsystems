#   nginx/         -> /etc/nginx              vhosts and snippets

# Two carve-outs in /srv/http (excluded paths are protected from --delete):

# cgi/ is a SIBLING of rootdomain/, not a subdirectory of it, so executables
# never land inside the docroot. If a location block is ever misconfigured,
# nginx has no path by which it could serve a CGI script's source. The same
# goes for status-sample/, assets-build/ and nginx/ — nothing outside
# rootdomain/ is reachable over HTTP.
#
# ORDER MATTERS. Content, then the things that read it, then nginx last: a
# vhost that references a new path should not go live before the path exists.

# typo would otherwise go straight to the live site and turn the status page
# into a 502 with no warning. Abort the WHOLE deploy — content included — if
# anything fails to compile, so the site and its scripts never go out of sync.
#
# These catch compile-time errors only, not logic ones. That is the point: a
# cheap gate against the realistic failure, not a test suite. nginx gets the
# same treatment, but it cannot be tested without installing first — see the
# nginx section for how that is made safe.

# two files and must not be deployed separately — which is why this lives here
# rather than being installed by hand.

# in every outcome. The RUNNING server is never at risk: a reload happens only
# after `nginx -t` passes, and nginx keeps serving the last good config until
# then.

# script never gets blamed for breakage it did not cause and never rolls a
# hand-edit back into a state it cannot test.
